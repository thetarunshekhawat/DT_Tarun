# Lab week plan — 161 students, Sessions 6–10, the 2×2 experiment

**This document is the single authority on the operative plan and the
infrastructure decision** (GitHub Codespaces primary; local VMs per
`provisioning/VM_DISTRIBUTION.md` as fallback).

**Cohort structure:** N=161 in two sections — Section 1 (n=80) meets 3
hours each morning, Section 2 (n=81) 3 hours each afternoon, Monday
through Friday. Both sections run the identical plan, staggered
morning/afternoon — which also caps peak Wi-Fi, Codespaces, and API
concurrency at ~80, never 161.

**Experimental design (plan of record):** the task set is **five
self-purchase categories** picked by the teaching team from the
11-category catalog in `tasks_config.csv` (a provisional five ships
active; no gift, no replenishment framing — every task is buying for
yourself), shopped in a **per-student randomized order** (derived from
the pseudonym, enforced by dtlab-start, identical for the human session
and all agent runs). Every student's picks are
committed on Wednesday; every agent then runs the SAME task set **four
times** in a within-student 2×2 — grounding (persona = questionnaire +
purchase profile vs. ablated = purchase profile only) × model tier
(economy/Haiku class vs. frontier/Sonnet class). **Tier order is
counterbalanced across the two lab days at the student level**: per the
counterbalance sheet, half of each section runs the economy model on
Thursday and the frontier model on Friday, the other half the reverse —
so the tier effect is identified separately from the day. Grounding
order is counterbalanced within each day (per-day
P_FIRST/NP_FIRST on the LMS list, orthogonal to tier order). Before any
treatment run, the agent writes the student's purchase profile once in
a short questionnaire-blind bootstrap session (Thursday, before run 1);
the profile is frozen and shared by all four runs. All students are
human-first;
**nobody watches their own agent** — self-selected pairs swap seats for
every run (assessment blinding + CAPTCHA handling; see
PERSONALIZATION_PROTOCOL.md Layer 4) — and **all verdicts are captured
in one blind Friday session** after run 4, where neither grounding nor
tier is knowable at judgment time. Recommended personal spend limit:
**$20** (four runs ≈ $3–6 with retries).

Three standing simplifications carried over from earlier drafts: the
agent reads the purchase history itself at Bootstrap (no extraction
pipeline; `data-pipeline/` is an optional post-course add-on);
infrastructure is Codespaces on the students' free GitHub accounts; the
agent shops the full site with only browsing-history-derived modules
banned and every candidate's provenance logged (PERSONALIZATION_PROTOCOL
Layer 2).

## Before the week (instructor/TA only — nothing is assigned to students early)

Students receive their first assignment IN Session 6. This works because
the questionnaire needs only the Form link and a pseudonym — any device,
no repo, no codespace — so it runs as Monday-evening homework, and
personas are generated centrally overnight. Instructor/TA readiness by
Sunday:

- [ ] Form built + test-submitted; instrument frozen.
- [ ] Assignment sheet ready to hand out Monday: pseudonym + per-day
      grounding order (Thu: P_FIRST/NP_FIRST; Fri: independently
      re-randomized) + **tier order** (economy-first or frontier-first
      across the two days), all stratified by section and generated
      together by `tools/make_counterbalance.py`; pairing instructions
      (self-selected pairs, registered on the sheet).
- [ ] Consent sheet + the LMS checklist pages staged (released Monday).
- [ ] Installer checksums pinned, template repo + Codespaces prebuilds
      live, CI green, dry run complete (docs/CHANGELOG.md T-21 list).

## Monday homework (assigned in Session 6 · due Monday 22:00)

- [ ] Consent & data-use sheet (`docs/CONSENT_AND_DATA_USE.md`:
      research participation separable from the course requirement;
      understanding + consent checkboxes repeated in the Form; names the
      partner-pairing disclosure and the ablated runs'
      constraint-blindness; synthetic-persona opt-out available).
- [ ] The 115-item questionnaire (~30 min; phone is fine — only the
      Form link and your pseudonym are needed).
- [ ] Own Anthropic Console account: billing, small credit purchase,
      personal **monthly spend limit ~$20**, one API key (~15 min). Your
      key is first needed at Tuesday's pre-flight — TA spare keys exist
      for setup casualties, but your own key is the deliverable.

Instructor Monday night: export Form responses →
`make_all_personas.py --zip` → per-student persona zips on the LMS;
chase stragglers via the roster output (regeneration takes seconds, so
Tuesday-morning stragglers are recoverable).

## Session 6 (Mon) — Agentic AI + the build begins

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:30 | Intro to agentic AI (slides). |
| 0:30–1:00 | Reading discussion: "Regulating advanced artificial agents" (Russell et al.). |
| 1:00–1:20 | The capstone project brief + consent walkthrough; hand out the assignment sheet — every student leaves knowing their pseudonym, pair, and per-day condition order — and assign tonight's homework (consent + Form + Anthropic account). |
| 1:20–2:30 | Create GitHub accounts, then codespaces from the codespace link on the LMS handout (first builds run while the room works); guided tour of the lab while builds run — the week's arc, the student commands, what the twin will and won't do. TAs circulate on build failures. |
| 2:30–3:00 | **Checkpoint 1 = codespace built + Lab Desktop opens** (no API key needed yet — the agent smoke run happens Tuesday, once keys exist); TAs note build failures for overnight triage. |
| Overnight | Students: consent + the 115-item Form (~30 min) + Anthropic account/key/$20 limit. Instructor: personas batch-generated → LMS; roster chase. |

## Session 7 (Tue) — Components, Architectures, Governance + build complete

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0:00–1:30 | Lecture: autonomous agents — components, architectures, governance (SOUL.md and the kit's enforcement machinery as the running case). |
| 1:30–2:40 | Hands-on completion: API key in (first `dtlab-start` prompt), persona files in, pre-flight green (it announces each student's randomized task order), one full sandbox agent run watched end-to-end. **Checkpoint 2 = fully green environment on your own key.** |
| 2:40–3:00 | Q&A on what the agent will and won't do; stragglers booked into office hours. |

## Session 8 (Wed) — Building with Hermes + the human session

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0:00–1:20 | **Hermes + SOUL.md deep dive**: building autonomous agents with Hermes-Agent — the agent identity file as the teaching material: identity, grounding, ECP logging, hard boundaries, injection hardening (read against tomorrow's first real runs). |
| 1:20–1:30 | Browsing-history pause (1 day) + payment-methods check. |
| 1:30–2:20 | **`dtlab-shop`** — everyone shops their tasks themselves, ONE AT A TIME in their assigned order (the terminal walks them through; Enter after each cart-add — this is what makes per-task searches/views/time exactly measurable), amazon.in login (OTP phones out), pick confirmation → committed picks. |
| 2:20–3:00 | Problem-resolution buffer: TAs clear every remaining red pre-flight; anyone not green books office hours before Thursday. |

## Session 9 (Thu) — "When to Specialize" + Experiment I: runs 1–2 (day-1 tier)

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:30 | Lecture + reading discussion: "When to Specialize" — GenAI model portfolios for demand sensing, framed by the week's live question (half the room runs the economy model today and the frontier model tomorrow; the other half the reverse — Friday's blind verdicts decide whether the frontier model earns its price). |
| 0:30–0:40 | Re-pause browsing history (pre-flight gate); pairs seated together; login check. |
| 0:40–0:50 | **Bootstrap phase** (first `dtlab-start`): the agent reads the student's order history and writes the frozen purchase profile — questionnaire-blind, partner supervising; no shopping happens. |
| 0:50–1:40 | **Agent run 1** (day-1 tier per the sheet; grounding per assigned order) — **swap seats**: partner babysits, handles CAPTCHAs, then runs `dtlab-cart` (cart screenshot + parsed contents, checked live against the agent's picks; intervention counts recorded) and empties the cart with Delete. |
| 1:40–1:50 | Swap back; break. Owners do NOT open logs or artifacts — verdicts happen Friday, blind. |
| 1:50–2:45 | **Agent run 2** (day-1 tier; other grounding) — same swap protocol; `dtlab-cart`; cart emptied. |
| 2:45–3:00 | Buffer + Q&A: TAs clear red pre-flights for Friday; partners confirm both runs' cart evidence is on file. No artifact viewing — Friday's verdict session is blind. |

## Session 10 (Fri) — Experiment II: runs 3–4 + the blind verdict session + debrief

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:15 | **Re-pause browsing history** (the 1-day pause has lapsed — pre-flight gates on it); pairs seated. |
| 0:15–1:10 | **Agent run 3** (day-2 tier per the sheet; grounding per Friday's re-randomized order) — swap protocol; `dtlab-cart`. |
| 1:10–2:00 | **Agent run 4** (day-2 tier; other grounding) — swap protocol; `dtlab-cart`; cart emptied. |
| 2:00–2:35 | **The blind verdict session** — `dtlab-verdict`, once, over all four runs: per task, the four picks appear as Run A–D (neither grounding nor tier identifiable); verdicts, ratings, rationales, head-to-heads; then the reveal; then Overall reflections. Stored verdicts are final. |
| 2:35–2:50 | `dtlab-pack`; upload the single zip via the BITSoM LMS assignment. |
| 2:50–3:00 | Debrief: hyperpersonalization / agentic demand commitments as the closing frame + live verdict poll from the room. |

**After Friday:** instructor runs `tools/analyze_cohort.py` across both
sections' zips, shares the cohort report with the class (weekend).
Full-class discussion of the report happens through the capstone white
paper
(and in any spare course slot if available).

## Capstone (individual white paper)

Out: when the cohort report is shared · Due: end of course · white
paper (report) of up to 5 pages. Full text: `docs/SYLLABUS_BLURB.md`.
In short: using BOTH your own evidence pack and the cohort report,
analyze the findings (what the questionnaire added, what the frontier
model changed, how agent and human shopping processes differed) and
draw the implications for business, for policy, and for consumers. An
A additionally requires new analyses (deeper analyses and/or extra
experiments with the agent — genAI and vibe coding encouraged) plus
external insights from credible academic papers and reports (APA
citations); polished prose free of genAI lingo. Graded on depth of
analysis and quality of argument — not on how well the twin performed.

## What can go wrong at N=161, and the pre-decided answer

| Risk | Answer |
|---|---|
| A student's codespace won't build | Delete + recreate (fresh container). Second failure → pair up for today; the evidence pack is per-ID, sharing a machine sequentially is acceptable in extremis. |
| amazon.in blocks/locks an account from a datacenter IP | Do NOT burn class time fighting Amazon. Pre-decided fallback, built once before the week: the student re-runs the sessions against the sandbox store — books.toscrape.com, the same target as the smoke test (or the instructor-hosted mock shop if one was built) — using the synthetic persona. Same tasks, same deliverables, same packer, graded identically; the pack is flagged `sandbox` and excluded from the research dataset. Mild cases first try phone-hotspot browsing for the human session. |
| A student has no/near-empty Amazon order history | Agent bootstrap writes a thin profile and says so — which is itself analyzable (the persona-only twin). Flag these IDs; they are a natural comparison subgroup, not failures. |
| A run doesn't finish inside its slot | With 5 tasks the SOUL's ~10-min per-task cap means a worst-case run brushes the ~55–60-min slots — **verify 5-task run timing in the dry run** (tighten the per-task cap or trim to 4 categories if needed). A run that stalls is cut at the effort cap, the partner runs dtlab-cart on whatever is in the cart, and dtlab-verdict notes the truncation. Two lost runs ≠ a lost student: the pack validates what exists (a missing run is a named issue, the zip still builds) and the analyzer handles missing cells. |
| Wi-Fi collapse under simultaneous sessions | ~80 concurrent noVNC desktop streams at ~1–3 Mbps each ≈ 160–300 Mbps sustained through the room in long-lived websockets — a different profile from the browsing the room's "100 concurrent users" rating assumes. Verify with IT before the week: WAN headroom ≥ 2× that estimate; ≤ ~25–30 active clients per access point on 5/6 GHz; no captive-portal re-auth or websocket idle timeout inside a 3-hour window; no per-user throttle below ~3 Mbps. Students keep phones on mobile data (OTPs arrive there anyway). Decisive check: a 15–20 student pilot in the actual room measuring per-stream bitrate. The section split caps concurrency at ~80, never 161. |
| Claude API rate limits with ~80 concurrent agents per section | Rate limits are per student account (own accounts, own keys) — there is no shared pool. One agent makes ~4–12 requests/min, far below per-account limits, and prompt-cache reads are exempt from input-token limits. Residual risk is an account not set up in time: Monday-night homework + Tuesday's checkpoint-2 pre-flight catch it; 2–3 course-owned spare keys cover stragglers. |
| Form submissions missing Monday 22:00 | The batch script's roster output + one reminder mail. Persona generation takes seconds per student; a Tuesday-morning regeneration for stragglers is fine. |
