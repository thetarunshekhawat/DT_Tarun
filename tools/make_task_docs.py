"""
make_task_docs.py — INSTRUCTOR tool: regenerate the task-dependent student
documents from tasks_config.csv, so a custom task set (e.g. the 6-task
utilitarian/hedonic design in tasks_config_6task_example.csv) never drifts
from what the packer validates.

USAGE (from repo root)
  python3 tools/make_task_docs.py [--config tasks_config.csv]
                                  [--outdir templates]

Writes: templates/tasks.md, templates/comparison.md,
templates/comparison_ablation.md. Run it AFTER editing the config, commit
the result, and re-run the test harness. The shipped templates for the
active 5-task self-purchase set ARE this generator's output for
tasks_config.csv — the harness round-trip check keeps them identical to
the generator; the packer validates submissions against the config
either way.
