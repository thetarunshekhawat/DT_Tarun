"""scrub_profile.py — post-extraction PII filter for bootstrap text.

Why this exists (dry run, 18 Aug 2026): the bootstrap agent titled the
profile with the REAL NAME on the Amazon account ("Purchase Profile:
<account holder>"), pulled from a saved address — despite the SOUL never
asking for it and the participant being pseudonymous (DT####-###). The
instructor's chosen fix is a deterministic filter AFTER extraction, not
another instruction to the model: instructions produced the leak;
filters remove it.

Policy (per the 18 Aug instructor call):
  * STRIP  — person names on the account/addresses, street addresses,
             city+PIN lines, phone numbers, emails, Amazon customer IDs.
  * KEEP   — age and every demographic the questionnaire already covers.
  * The profile must end up attributed to the PSEUDONYM, never a name.

The names to strip cannot be hard-coded and are NOT stored: the launcher
passes them on stdin, the scrubber uses them in memory, and then discards
them. They never appear in the process command line. Only counts are
reported.

Fail-closed: every requested file is read and scrubbed in memory first.
No file is rewritten if a target is missing/empty or a supplied name (or
one of its scrub-worthy tokens) survives in any output.

Usage:
  printf '%s\n' "Name One,Name Two" | scrub_profile.py \
    --profile PATH --text-file PATH --student-id DT####-### --names-stdin
